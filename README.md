Mastodon is a **free, open-source social network server** based on ActivityPub where users can follow friends and discover new ones. On Mastodon, users can publish anything they want: links, pictures, text, and video. All Mastodon servers are interoperable as a federated network (users on one server can seamlessly communicate with users from another one, including non-Mastodon software that implements ActivityPub!)

## Features

<img src="/app/javascript/images/elephant_ui_working.svg?raw=true" align="right" width="30%" />

### No vendor lock-in: Fully interoperable with any conforming platform

It doesn't have to be Mastodon; whatever implements ActivityPub is part of the social network! [Learn more](https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2018/06/why-activitypub-is-the-future/)

### Real-time, chronological timeline updates

Updates of people you're following appear in real-time in the UI via WebSockets. There's a firehose view as well!

### Media attachments like images and short videos

Upload and view images and WebM/MP4 videos attached to the updates. Videos with no audio track are treated like GIFs; normal videos loop continuously!

### Safety and moderation tools

Mastodon includes private posts, locked accounts, phrase filtering, muting, blocking, and all sorts of other features, along with a reporting and moderation system. [Learn more](https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2018/07/cage-the-mastodon/)

### OAuth2 and a straightforward REST API

Mastodon acts as an OAuth2 provider, so 3rd party apps can use the REST and Streaming APIs. This results in a rich app ecosystem with a lot of choices!

## Deployment

### Tech stack

- **Ruby on Rails** powers the REST API and other web pages
- **React.js** and Redux are used for the dynamic parts of the interface
- **Node.js** powers the streaming API

### Requirements

- **PostgreSQL** 9.5+
- **Redis** 4+
- **Ruby** 2.7+
- **Node.js** 14+

The repository includes deployment configurations for **Docker and docker-compose** as well as specific platforms like **Heroku**, **Scalingo**, and **Nanobox**. For Helm charts, reference the [mastodon/chart repository](https://github.com/mastodon/chart). The [**standalone** installation guide](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/admin/install/) is available in the documentation.

## Development

### Vagrant

A **Vagrant** configuration is included for development purposes. To use it, complete the following steps:

- Install Vagrant and Virtualbox
- Install the `vagrant-hostsupdater` plugin: `vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater`
- Run `vagrant up`
- Run `vagrant ssh -c "cd /vagrant && foreman start"`
- Open `http://mastodon.local` in your browser

### MacOS

To set up **MacOS** for native development, complete the following steps:

- Install the latest stable Ruby version (use a Ruby version manager for easy installation and management of Ruby versions)
- Run `brew install postgresql@14`
- Run `brew install redis`
- Run `brew install imagemagick`
- Install Foreman or a similar tool (such as [overmind](https://github.com/DarthSim/overmind)) to handle multiple process launching.
- Navigate to Mastodon's root directory and run `brew install nvm` then `nvm use` to use the version from .nvmrc
- Run `corepack enable && yarn set version classic`
- Run `bundle exec rails db:setup` (optionally prepend `RAILS_ENV=development` to target the dev environment)
- Finally, run `overmind start -f Procfile.dev`

### Docker

For development with **Docker**, complete the following steps:

- Install Docker Desktop
- Run `docker compose -f .devcontainer/docker-compose.yml up -d`
- Run `docker compose -f .devcontainer/docker-compose.yml exec app .devcontainer/post-create.sh`
- Finally, run `docker compose -f .devcontainer/docker-compose.yml exec app foreman start -f Procfile.dev`

If you are using an IDE with [support for the Development Container specification](https://containers.dev/supporting), it will run the above `docker compose` commands automatically. For **Visual Studio Code** this requires the [Dev Container extension](https://containers.dev/supporting#dev-containers).

### GitHub Codespaces

To get you coding in just a few minutes, GitHub Codespaces provides a web-based version of Visual Studio Code and a cloud-hosted development environment fully configured with the software needed for this project..

- Click this button to create a new codespace:<br>
  [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=main&repo=52281283&devcontainer_path=.devcontainer%2Fcodespaces%2Fdevcontainer.json)
- Wait for the environment to build. This will take a few minutes.
- When the editor is ready, run `foreman start -f Procfile.dev` in the terminal.
- After a few seconds, a popup will appear with a button labeled _Open in Browser_. This will open Mastodon.
- On the _Ports_ tab, right click on the ‚Äústream‚Äù row and select _Port visibility_ ‚Üí _Public_.
